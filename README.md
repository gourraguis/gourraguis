### Hello, I'm Abderrahmane.

I build systems that act as a **force multiplier**. My focus is on shipping solutions that solve real problems, which means my work isn't done until the team I'm supporting is more capable and effective. 

This could mean re-architecting a microservice to **cut costs by 57%** at Deel, empowering a marketing team to be self-sufficient at Turing, or integrating an AI model at Al Jazeera that **saves reporters 20% of their time**.

You can ask my AI assistant about the stories behind my work at [gourragui.com](https://gourragui.com/).

## My Open Source Projects

I believe in building in public and sharing what I learn. Here are a couple of projects I've created.

**[Glasses MCP ðŸ‘“](https://github.com/gourraguis/glasses-mcp)**
> A simple but powerful tool that gives AI assistants the ability to "see" the web. It acts as a server that can take device-specific screenshots of any URL, giving visual context to language models.

**[AI-Powered Portfolio](https://github.com/gourraguis/fixer)**
> My personal portfolio, designed to be a bold and confident AI-powered conversational experience. It allows visitors to interact with a chatbot that knows my professional story, turning a static resume into a dynamic conversation.

## My Guiding Principles

These principles aren't just words on a page; they are the framework for how I build software and collaborate with teams.

## My Toolkit

Technology is a means to an end, but having the right toolsâ€”and knowing them wellâ€”is crucial. Here are the ones I've used most extensively.

- **Languages:** Python, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Vue.js
- **Backend:** NestJS, Express.js, FastAPI, Serverless
- **AI & ML:** PyTorch, Hugging Face, LlamaIndex, LangChain
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, GCP, Docker, GitHub Actions

> **That Time I Broke Everything with Git.**
> I messed up a rebase badly when I first joined CodinGame. My tech lead had me read the *Pro Git* book cover to cover. I've been a git wizard ever since.
