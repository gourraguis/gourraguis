> I believe the best way to grow is to assume I'm not better than average. This student's mindset helps me listen, ask, and learn continuously. It’s not about self-doubt, but a practical path to improvement—focusing on the journey, not just achievements. Viewing work as practice frees me from fearing mistakes, empowering exploration, deep learning, and building impactful solutions.

## What Do I Do?

I write code to solve problems. Mostly, that means building full-stack web applications – think Python on the backend, React on the frontend. I've also been integrating AI models into projects where it adds real value.
